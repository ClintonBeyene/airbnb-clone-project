## 🧱 Technology Stack

The following technologies are used to build and manage the Airbnb Clone project. Each component plays a crucial role in developing a scalable, secure, and collaborative web application:

### 🔹 Django

* **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build robust backend systems and RESTful/GraphQL APIs efficiently. It provides built-in support for authentication, admin panels, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.

### 🔹 MySQL

* **Purpose**: A relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores structured data, such as user profiles, bookings, listings, and reviews. It ensures reliable data storage, query optimization, and relationship management.

### 🔹 GraphQL

* **Purpose**: A flexible and efficient query language for APIs, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need. It replaces traditional REST APIs with a single endpoint and improves frontend-backend communication.

### 🔹 Docker

* **Purpose**: A containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated environments. It ensures consistent deployment across different systems and simplifies setup and scaling.

### 🔹 GitHub & Git

* **Purpose**: Version control tools used to manage source code, track changes, and enable collaboration between team members. GitHub also hosts the repository and facilitates issue tracking, branching, and pull requests.

### 🔹 GitHub Actions

* **Purpose**: A CI/CD automation tool that runs tests, performs linting, and deploys the application automatically when code is pushed. It helps streamline development workflows and catch issues early.

### 🔹 Markdown

* **Purpose**: A lightweight markup language used for creating project documentation (e.g., `README.md`). It allows developers to write formatted text for instructions, descriptions, and technical reference.

## 🗄️ Database Design

Key entities and their relationships:

* **Users**: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `date_joined`
  *Can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.*

* **Properties**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`
  *Belongs to one user; can have many bookings and reviews.*

* **Bookings**: `id`, `property_id`, `guest_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`
  *Belongs to one property and one user.*

* **Reviews**: `id`, `property_id`, `author_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  *Written by users for properties.*

* **Payments**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`
  *Linked to one booking.*

---

### Relationships summary:

* Users ↔ Properties (one-to-many)
* Properties ↔ Bookings (one-to-many)
* Users ↔ Bookings (one-to-many)
* Properties ↔ Reviews (one-to-many)
* Bookings ↔ Payments (one-to-one)

## 🚩 Feature Breakdown

* **User Management**

* **Property Management**
  Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. It supports detailed descriptions, pricing, and location data to attract potential guests.

* **Booking System**
  Allows guests to search for properties, make reservations, and view booking history. It manages availability and ensures smooth transaction flow between users.

* **Review System**
  Provides guests the ability to leave ratings and comments on properties they have stayed at. This feedback builds trust and helps maintain quality.

* **Payment Processing**
  Facilitates secure payment transactions linked to bookings. It tracks payment status to ensure both hosts and guests have a reliable financial experience.
